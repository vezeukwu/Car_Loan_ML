A Machine learning prediction of whether a customer will default in paying back loan
I developed a Decision Tree Classifier model to analyze the bankâ€™s car loan dataset, uncovering key factors influencing loan defaults. 
After performing extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends. 
The model achieved high predictive accuracy, successfully estimating the likelihood of customers defaulting on loan repayments. 
Additionally, the model provided actionable insights by determining the optimal maximum loan amount customers could access, enabling the bank to minimize future defaults and enhance its risk assessment process.
